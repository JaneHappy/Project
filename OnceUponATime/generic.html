						<h2>Series overview</h2>
						<p></p>
					</header>
					<p>During the first six seasons, the series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales and other stories that were transported to the "real world" town and robbed of their original memories by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla) who used a powerful curse obtained from Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle). The residents of Storybrooke, where Regina is its mayor, have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. </p>
					<p>The town's only hope lies with a bail-bonds person named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest to our world via a magic tree as an infant before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she was recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his Once Upon a Time book of fairy tales that holds the key to breaking the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women.</p>

								<h3>Content</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Episodes usually have one segment that details the characters' past lives that, when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences. The other, set in the present day, follows a similar pattern with a different outcome but also offers similar insights.</p>

								<h3>Setting</h3>

							<p>The episodes consist mainly of two different settings, one involving one or more characters' backstory, the other set in the present day. At times an additional story will have a connection tied to the two stories.</p>
