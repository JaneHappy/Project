								<h3>Enchanted Forest</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The Enchanted Forest is a realm within Fairy Tale Land. The actual spread and scope of the Enchanted Forest is currently unknown. However they were later united during the Ogre Wars, which played a part in the formation of the War Council that was formed by Prince Charming and served as the catalysts in the backstories involving Rumpelstiltskin and Regina, the Evil Queen.</p>
							<!--<p>Several independent kingdoms are implied by an array of different rulers, including Snow White's father King Leopold (the kingdom later ruled by his widow Regina, the Evil Queen), Cora's father-in-law King Xavier, Princess Abigail's father King Midas, Charming's (secretly adoptive) father King George (Charming and Snow rule his kingdom after deposing him), Cinderella's father-in-law, and Sir Maurice, Belle's father. Most of the stories detailed their earlier lives before ascension to power and being influenced by their mentors through their upbringings.</p>-->

								<h3>Land Without Magic</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The Land Without Magic (often dubbed the Real World) is shown to be a magic-less land not bound to the Land With Magic Universe. It is often said that travelling to the Land Without Magic is hard. However, it is shown that various characters from different lands are able to reach the Land Without Magic by different means. For example, the Snow Queen came to the Land Without Magic in 1982 with the Apprentice's help. Other means of travelling to this land are magical doors created by the Apprentice, magic beans, or the Dark Curse that is responsible for the creation of Storybrooke in Maine.</p>

								<h3>Expanded Settings<br/></h3>
							</header>
							<p>The realms and worlds featured in the series are mostly based on many fairy tales, mythologies and real life locations and are magical, unlike the real world which is dubbed the Land Without Magic. Just like the Enchanted Forest, the other realms and worlds were affected by the Evil Queenâ€™s curse, but indirectly, merely freezing them in time and state for twenty-eight years.</p>

						<h2>Series overview</h2>
						<p>During the first six seasons, the series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales and other stories that were transported to the "real world" town and robbed of their original memories by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla) who used a powerful curse obtained from Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle). The residents of Storybrooke, where Regina is its mayor, have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. The town's only hope lies with a bail-bonds person named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest to our world via a magic tree as an infant before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she was recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his Once Upon a Time book of fairy tales that holds the key to breaking the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women.</p>

								<h3>Content</h3>
								<!--<h3>Series overview</h3>-->
							</header>
							<p>Episodes usually have one segment that details the characters' past lives that, when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences. The other, set in the present day, follows a similar pattern with a different outcome but also offers similar insights.</p>

								<h3>Setting</h3>

							<p>The episodes consist mainly of two different settings, one involving one or more characters' backstory, the other set in the present day. At times an additional story will have a connection tied to the two stories.</p>
